# shareit

The intent of this project is to store some information like URLs, texts and pictures for myself or someone else, like a personal bookmarks.

This is not the code I'm proud of because it's very simple. There is a lot of work needs to be done and right now you should consider this only as an example not a complete product.

In this project I use:
 * Django 4
 * Pillow
 * JavaScript + JQuery

What I did here:
* simple anti brute force auth backend
* user interface has a roulette which you can use to switch between bookmarks
* there are few commands in "management" folder that can be used as cron jobs to clean up old entries
* crucial parts of the code covered with tests
* there is a different template for mobile users

Use docker to run the application
