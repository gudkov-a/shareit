# shareit

The intent of this project is to store some information like URLs, texts and pictures for myself or someone else, like a personal bookmarks.

This is not the code I'm proud of. There are a lot of work need to be done and right now you should consider this only as an example not a complete product.

In this project I use:
 * Django 2.2
 * Pillow
 * JavaScript + JQuery
 * SQlite
